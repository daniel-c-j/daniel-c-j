## Hi there 👋

Daniel CJ here.

I'm a digital technology ethusiast currently lurking in the web development. I also do mobile development with Flutter, scripting with Python either for automation or destroying operating systems. While my tech stacks seems all front-end focused, I also do back-ends... Sometimes :) 

There isn't a lot that stands out as interesting about me. I just like learning something new because I find it entertaining and addicting (Just like caffeine☕).
